# 0x03. C - Debugging

Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly. As you become a more advanced programmer and an industry engineer, you will learn how to use debugging tools such as gdb or built-in tools that IDEs have. However, it’s important to understand the concepts and processes of debugging manually.

# Learning Objectives

## General

- What is debugging
- What are some methods of debugging manually
- How to read the error messages

# Requirements

## General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All your files should end with a new line
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project (i.e. 0x03-debugging), describing what this project is about

# Tasks

0. [Multiple mains](./0-main.c) : In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project:
1. [Like, comment, subscribe](./1-main.c) : Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
2. [0 > 972?](./2-largest_number.c) : This program prints the largest of three integers.
3. [Leap year](./3-print_remaining_days.c) : This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
